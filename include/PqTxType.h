// Value 0x02 is permanently RESERVED (it was the never-deployed legacy bridge
// subtype) and MUST stay rejected by consensus — do not reuse it without a hard
// fork. Removing the name does not change the wire: any tx with txType==0x02
// still falls through to the "unknown PQ tx subtype" reject path.
//
// TX_PQ_V2 exists because the delivery format is NOT visible on the wire: a
// PqOutput is {kemCt, encPayload, spendCommit} either way, and the out_context
// that separates pre-v2 from v2 is derived by the recipient and never
// transmitted. A validator therefore cannot inspect an output and tell which
// derivation produced it. The subtype is a WRITER DECLARATION, made binding by
// refusing the old declaration after the activation height: it does not prove
// any particular output decrypts under v2, it guarantees that software still
// emitting the pre-v2 derivation fails loudly instead of paying into an output
// its recipient may never find. Spending pre-fork outputs stays legal forever —
// the rule constrains how outputs are CREATED, never what they reference.
//
// txType is inside the §8.1 signing digest, so the declaration is signature-
// bound for free and an old signature cannot be relabelled in flight.
